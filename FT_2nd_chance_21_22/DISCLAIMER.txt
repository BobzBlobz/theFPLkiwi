Please note that these 2nd chance projections are just roughly transformed from the normal FanTeam numbers.

This is a hacky attempt to account for the safety net.

These are not guaranteed the same level of accuracy as the other model outputs and do not follow the same level of rigour in how the numbers are reached.

I do however use these numbers myself :)
