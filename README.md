Files

1. A dictionary to translate between FPL / fbref / FFscout / Kiwi moniker for 17/18-21/22 including IDs from FPL, FanTeam, & FBref.

2. Data for hindsight-based optimisation of FPL season 20/21. This includes all players with their FPL ID, position, team (both if they played for two as well as the date of their transfer in-game), score in each GW (blank if they did not play), price on every day of the season (with an hour of 12 if they were added to the game after the GW deadline that day).

3. A supplementary file for the hindsight data, containing the dates of each GW.

4. A smaller file than (1) containing only IDs.

5. CSV files of points projections for all players for every GW. Will not be accurate past GW15 (When Chelsea go to the Club World Cup so rearrange their fixtures). Last update: 20 Aug 2021, pre-GW2.
