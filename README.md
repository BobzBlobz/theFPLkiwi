Files

1. A dictionary to translate between FPL / fbref / FFscout / Kiwi moniker for 17/18-20/21 (not perfect, will work on incorporating IDs for scrapers as it is aimed at users like me who copy+paste data directly).

2. Data for hindsight-based optimisation of FPL season 20/21. This includes all players with their FPL ID, position, team (both if they played for two as well as the date of their transfer in-game), score in each GW (blank if they did not play), price on every day of the season (with an hour of 12 if they were added to the game after the GW deadline that day)

3. A supplementary file for the hindsight data, containing the dates of each GW.

4. A match-up of 21/22 FPL IDs with FBref IDs.

5. A csv file of initial points projections for all players, both Total and Adjusted (+2pts per no-show), as well as xMins data (as of 5/8/21). Includes proposed/completed transfers Willock (NEW), Lukaku (CHE), Varane (MUN), Romero (TOT), Ings (AVL), Grealish (MCI), with appropriately guessed prices for those not added to the game. Does not include moves for Kane (TOT), Adam Armstrong (championship), Brandon Williams (MUN). The "Adjusted" column shows total points +2 for every non-appearance, simulating a player coming on from the bench to replace them.
